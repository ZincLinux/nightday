# ZincLinux' Night and Day Wallpapers

ZincLinux features 'Night and Day', a small python program to
switch xfce settings and other configs to and from dark-mode.

~/Pictures/wallpaper/ contains both 'dark' and 'light' subfolders.
Night and Day will switch between any sets of images in these
subfolders with the exact same name.

You may continue to use this wallpaper folder normally. If you want
to add to the dark and light wallpaper subfolders, be sure that they
always contain files of the exact same name.

To prevent Night and Day from changing wallpapers, select a
background in a path doesn't contain '/dark/' or '/light/'.

It is strongly recommended to name you personal /dark/.. and /light/..
images with the prefix 'p-', ie: p-01.jpg ... so that it isn't
overwritten by an update.
